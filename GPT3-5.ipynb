    "    \n",
    "    CLASSIFICATION PROCESS:\n",
    "    1. First, split the host description into meaningful phrases (groups of words that convey a single idea).\n",
    "    2. For each phrase, follow this STRICT hierarchy to determine its theme:\n",
    "    \n",
    "       a) FIRST CHECK: Personal Charisma\n",
    "          * Self-descriptions, background, personality traits, interests, profession, lifestyle\n",
    "          * Examples: \"I am a writer\", \"love traveling\", \"passionate about cooking\", \"dog lover\"\n",
    "          * ONLY if the phrase primarily describes WHO THE HOST IS or WHAT THEY ENJOY\n",
    "    \n",
    "       b) IF NOT Personal Charisma, THEN CHECK: Friendly Attitudes\n",
    "          * Expressions of warmth, welcome, hosting philosophy, how they treat guests\n",
    "          * Examples: \"warm welcome\", \"make you feel at home\", \"respect your privacy\"\n",
    "          * ONLY if the phrase describes the HOST'S ATTITUDE toward guests\n",
    "    \n",
    "       c) IF NOT Friendly Attitudes, THEN CHECK: Service & Assistance\n",
    "          * Specific services, help, or support offered to guests\n",
    "          * Examples: \"provide local recommendations\", \"available 24/7\", \"happy to answer questions\"\n",
    "          * ONLY if the phrase describes WHAT THE HOST WILL DO FOR guests\n",
    "    \n",
    "       d) IF NOT Service & Assistance, THEN CHECK: Socialisation & Sharing\n",
    "          * Interaction with guests, shared experiences, community aspects\n",
    "          * Examples: \"love meeting new people\", \"enjoy showing guests around\", \"share meals together\"\n",
    "          * ONLY if the phrase describes INTERACTION or SHARED EXPERIENCES\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. If a phrase could fit multiple categories, STRICTLY follow the hierarchy above. Do not classify the same phrase into multiple themes.\n",
    "    4. Use EXACT PHRASES from the text - do not paraphrase or summarize.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    FIRST PASS - Extract All Potential Phrases:\n",
    "    1. Identify meaningful complete phrases that might fit any of these themes:\n",
    "       * Personal Charisma: Host background, personality, interests, lifestyle (WHO THEY ARE)\n",
    "       * Friendly Attitudes: Expressions of welcome, warmth, hospitality (HOW THEY FEEL about guests)\n",

    "    \n",
    "    SECOND PASS - Resolve Ambiguities & Eliminate Overlaps:\n",
    "    2. For each phrase that could fit multiple themes, apply these PRIORITY RULES:\n",
    "       * If the phrase primarily describes the host themselves → Personal Charisma\n",
    "       * If the phrase describes specific host actions for guests → Service & Assistance\n",
    "       * If the phrase describes the host's demeanor or attitude → Friendly Attitudes\n",
    "       * If the phrase involves direct interaction or shared activities → Socialisation & Sharing\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. For borderline phrases, use these TIEBREAKER QUESTIONS:\n",
    "       * \"Is this mainly about who the host is?\" → Personal Charisma\n",
    "       * \"Is this mainly about what the host will do to help?\" → Service & Assistance\n",
    "       * \"Is this mainly about the host's attitude?\" → Friendly Attitudes\n",
    "       * \"Is this mainly about spending time together?\" → Socialisation & Sharing\n",
    "    \n",
    "    CRITICAL RULES:\n",
    "    - NEVER classify the same phrase into multiple themes\n",
    "    - Use EXACT PHRASES from the text\n",

    "           - Each phrase must be classified into EXACTLY ONE theme\n",
    "           - When a phrase contains features from multiple themes, assign it to the theme whose core features are MOST DOMINANT\n",
    "           - If genuinely ambiguous, use this tiebreaker priority: Personal Charisma > Service & Assistance > Friendly Attitudes > Socialisation & Sharing\n",

    "           - Information provision (e.g., \"give recommendations\", \"share local tips\")\n",
    "           - Responsiveness (e.g., \"quick to respond\", \"available 24/7\")\n",
    "           - Problem-solving (e.g., \"solve any issues\", \"address concerns promptly\")\n",
    "\n",
    "           ### SOCIALISATION & SHARING\n",
    "           PRIMARY FOCUS: INTERACTIVE EXPERIENCES BETWEEN HOST AND GUEST\n",
    "           Must extract phrases about:\n",
    "           - Social interaction desires (e.g., \"enjoy meeting new people\", \"love to chat with guests\")\n",
    "           - Shared activities (e.g., \"happy to show you around\", \"can explore the city together\")\n",
    "           - Community connections (e.g., \"introduce you to locals\", \"connect with neighborhood\")\n",
    "           - Cultural exchange (e.g., \"share stories\", \"learn about different cultures\")\n",
    "           - Joint experiences (e.g., \"have meals together\", \"join for coffee\")\n",
    "\n",
    "        ## CRITICAL DISAMBIGUATION RULES:\n",
    "\n",
    "        When a phrase could belong to multiple themes, use these STRICT tiebreakers:\n",
    "        1. Focus on the PRIMARY INTENT of the phrase, not secondary elements\n",
    "        2. If about personality/interests/background → PERSONAL CHARISMA\n",
    "        3. If about feelings toward hosting/guests → FRIENDLY ATTITUDES\n",
    "        4. If about concrete services/help provided → SERVICE & ASSISTANCE\n",
    "        5. If about doing things together with guests → SOCIALISATION & SHARING\n",
    "\n",
    "        ## TEXT EXTRACTION REQUIREMENTS:\n",
    "\n",
    "        1. VERBATIM EXTRACTION ONLY: Phrases must appear EXACTLY as written in the original text\n",
    "        2. COMPLETE THOUGHTS: Extract complete semantic units, not fragments\n",
    "        3. MAXIMALLY INCLUSIVE: When in doubt about phrase boundaries, include contextual words\n",
    "        4. NON-OVERLAPPING: Each word can only appear in ONE theme classification\n",
    "        5. EXHAUSTIVE CAPTURE: Identify ALL relevant phrases for each theme to maximize recall\n",
    "\n",
    "        ## QUALITY CHECK PROCEDURE:\n",
    "\n",
    "        After classification, perform these verification steps:\n",
    "        1. OVERLAP CHECK: Ensure NO phrase appears in multiple themes\n",
    "        2. VERBATIM CHECK: Verify ALL phrases appear exactly in the original text\n",
    "        3. COMPLETENESS CHECK: Ensure ALL relevant phrases are captured\n",
    "        4. BALANCE CHECK: Aim for similar volume of extraction across all applicable themes\n",
    "\n",
    "        If no content exists for a theme, use \"None detected\" - but exhaust all possibilities first.\n",
