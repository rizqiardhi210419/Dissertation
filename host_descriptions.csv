"I have been a host with Airbnb since its introduction into the NYC market, early 2009.  Since then I've made a commitment to share my home/sanctuary/city with a non-pretentious open approach.  Above all my spaces are clean, comfortable and convenient.  With an eclectic mix of vintage and modern, little touches of nature and infused with curated pieces from around the world -  they are reflection of my interests, travels and passions.  So if you're planning a trip to Brooklyn and want to be hosted by a Native-New Yorker who has made it her business to provide a place that will make you feel like you are home away from home, shoot me an e-mail.   

I look forward to sharing House on Henry, Casa Barcelona and Henry's Local Cafe with you!"
"I grew up in South Korea, moved to Montreal, Canada and have been a New Yorker for decades. I presently work as a freelance interpreter and translator for NYS courts, DA's office, and others in need of language services. I am easy-going, friendly, tidy, respectful of others, responsive to guest's needs, and enthusiastic about meeting new people from all walks of life and all over the world!"
I am an architect living in NYC and have my own design firm Buro Koray Duman Architects. I live in LES with my husband and our daughter.
"I am a self employed licensed real estate broker, investor, and certified income tax preparer.  I own and live in this restored century old brownstone in a vibrant neighborhood in Brooklyn, NY, where I rent 2 of the apartments.
